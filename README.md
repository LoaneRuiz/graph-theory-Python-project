# graph-theory-Python-project
### Python project from the first-year enginneering program at ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris.
The goal of this project was to provide a first practical application of Python skills and to introduce graph theory.
It focuses on finding the least-cost matching of elements in a grid using graph algorithms, in particular bipartite graphs, under a set of predefined constraints.
